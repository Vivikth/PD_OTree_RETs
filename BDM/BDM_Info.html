<p>In this experiment, I want to determine how much you value completing a task or how much you value items. <br>
    I will use the switch-point procedure for this purpose. <br>
    I'll explain the procedure using 2 cases. </p>
<br>

<h2> Case 1: Monetary Value</h2>
<p>
    Let's suppose that I want to determine how much Tim values a pencil, in terms of money.
    I would ask Tim the following questions:
</p>

    {{ include 'BDM/SPA.html'}}

<br>

<p>
    The 2nd column (from the left) in the table shows the question that I would ask Tim.
    In each question, Tim picks either option A (the pencil) or option B (the money).
    After Tim has answered all 2001 questions, I will randomly pick one question, and give Tim the option that he chose on that question.
    Each question is equally likely to be chosen for payment.
    Obviously Tim has no incentive to lie on any question, because if that question gets chosen for payment then Tim would end up with the option he likes less.
</p>
<p>
    I assume that Tim would choose Option A in at least the first few questions, but at some point switch to choosing Option B. <br>
    So, to save time, I'd just ask Tim to tell me at which dollar value he'd switch.  I can then ‘fill out’ Tim's answers to all 2001 questions based on his switch point (choosing Option A for all questions before his switch point, and Option B for all questions at or after his switch point). <br>
    To summarise, the switch-point procedure is when I provide you a list of questions like in the above table, and ask you for when you'd switch from choosing option A to option B.
    To make things more concrete, lets look at two examples.
</p>
<h4> Example 1a</h4>
<p>
    Suppose Tim's true switch point is $10 (which is question number 1001).
    So, if I offered Tim less than $10, he would prefer to receive the pencil.
    Likewise, if I offered Tim more than $10, he would prefer to receive the money.
</p>

<p>
    Now, let's suppose Tim lies and tells me that his switch point is $8.
    Also, let's suppose that question 901 (which corresponds to $9) was randomly selected.
    Since Tim's switch point has said his switch-point is $8, I would give him the money.
    However, Tim would prefer the pencil to $9.
    So, if Tim lies about his switch-point he may end up receive an outcome he prefers less!
</p>

<h4> Example 1b</h4>
<p>
    Now, suppose that Tim prefers the pencil to $20.
    Then, if I offer Tim any amount below $20, he would prefer the pencil.
    So, Tim would tell me that his switch point is $20, even though he prefers the pencil to $20.
    By stating that his switch-point is the highest possible value, Tim receives the outcome he prefers most (the pencil).
</p>


<h2> Case Two</h2>
<p>
    I can also apply the switch-point procedure to determine how much you value an item in terms of a lottery.
    Let's suppose I want to determine how much Luke values a pencil in terms of the probability that Luke gets to leave the experiment right now (and gets full payment), or Luke has to read some boring information and answer some questions on it, then continue with the experiment.
    In this case, I would ask Luke the following questions:
</p>

    {{ include 'BDM/SPB.html'}}
<br>

<p>
    Like the monetary example above, in each question, Luke picks either option A (the pencil) or option B (the lottery). <br>
    Unlike the monetary example, there will be a 1% chance that I will randomly select a question and give Luke the option that he chose on that question. <br>
    Luke still has no reason to lie on any question, because if that question gets chosen for payment then Luke would end up with the option he likes less. <br>
</p>
<p>
    Let's suppose that I randomly pick a question (which has a 1% chance of happening).<br>
    If Luke chose the pencil on the question I picked, he would get the pencil for sure. <br>
    If Luke chose the lottery on the question I picked, I would run the lottery in that question. <br>
    Luke would get to leave the experiment (and receive the full monetary compensation) if that was the outcome from the lottery, or have to read the boring information and answer questions otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    I assume Luke is going to choose the Option A in at least the first few questions, but at some point will switch to choosing Option B. <br>
    So, to save time, I'd ask Luke to tell me the percentage chance of leaving that would cause him to switch from Option A to Option B. <br>
    I can then ‘fill out’ his answers to all 101 questions based on his switch point (choosing Option A for all questions before his switch point, and Option B for all questions at or after his switch point). <br>
    Again, if Luke lies about his true switch point, then he might end up getting an option that you like less. <br>
    To make things more concrete, lets look at an example.
</p>

<h4> Example 2a</h4>
<p>
    Suppose that Luke always prefers the lottery to the pencil.
    Then, if I offer Luke any percentage chance of leaving, he would prefer the lottery.
    So, Luke would tell me that his switch point is 0%, even though he prefers the 0% lottery to the pencil.
    By stating that his switch-point is the highest possible value, Luke always receives the outcome he prefers most (the lottery).
</p>


<h2> Summary</h2>
<p>
    The switch-point procedure is a way that I can determine your valuation for a task or an item. <br>
    Your switch point is the monetary value (or percentage chance of leaving) that causes you to switch from option A to option B <br>
    You have no reason to lie about your switch-point, because lying might leave you with an outcome that you prefer less. <br>
