<p>In this experiment, I want to determine how much you value completing a task or how much you value items. <br>
    I will use the switch-point procedure for this purpose. <br>
    Essentially, the switch-point procedure is where I provide you with two options, and ask when you'd switch from choosing one option to the next.
    I'll explain 3 variants of the procedure. </p>
<br>

<h3>The pseudo switch-point procedure</h3>
<p>
    Let's suppose that I want to determine how much Tim values a pencil. <br>
    Here are the steps I'd take. <br>
</p>

<h5>Step 1: Give Tim a list of questions</h5>
<p>
    The first thing I'd do is give a Tim a list of questions like the ones in the table below. <br>
    Each row in the table (apart from the header row) shows a question that I'd ask Tim.
    In each question, Tim picks either option A (the pencil) or option B (the money).
</p>

<br>
<h5>Step 2: Tell Tim one question will be randomly selected</h5>
<p>
    All questions are equally likely to be selected.
</p>
<h5>Step 3: Tim fills out his preferred option for each question in the table </h5>
<p>
    It's important to note that Tim has no reason to lie about which option he prefers for any question in the table. <br>
    Why? Because if Tim lies on a question, and that question gets chosen for payment then Tim would end up with the option he likes less.
</p>
<h5>Step 4: Tim fills out his preferred option for each question in the table </h5>
<p>
    I randomly select a question, and give Tim the option he picked on that question. <br>
    For instance, if I randomly selected question 1001 (which corresponds to $10.00), and Tim said he preferred the pencil on that question, I would give Tim the pencil.
</p>
That's all there is to the pseudo switch-point procedure!
<h5>The issue with the pseudo switch-point procedure</h5>
<p>
    The issue with the pseudo switch-point procedure is that Tim has to answer 2001 questions. <br>
    A reasonable assumption is that Tim prefers option A for the first few questions, but at some point will switch to choosing option B. <br>
    So, to save time, I'll just ask Tim for his <b>switch-point</b>: the monetary value at which he'd switch from choosing option A to option B. <br>
    The steps for the switch-point procedure are given below.
</p>
<h3> The monetary switch-point procedure </h3>
<h5>Step 1: Give Tim a list of questions</h5>
<p>
    The first thing I'd do is give a Tim a list of questions like the ones in the table below. This is identical to the above table. <br>
</p>
    {{ include 'BDM/SPA.html'}}
<br>
<h5>Step 2: Tell Tim one question will be randomly selected</h5>
<p>
    All questions are equally likely to be selected.
</p>
<h5>Step 3: Ask Tim for his switch-point </h5>
<p>
    Once Tim has told me his switch-point, I can ‘fill out’ Tim's answers to all 2001 questions based on his switch point (choosing Option A for all questions before his switch point, and Option B for all questions at or after his switch point). <br>
    Tim still has no reason to lie about his switch-point, as lying might lead to an option that he prefers less.
</p>
<h5>Step 4: Pick a question at random </h5>
<p>
    Finally, I will randomly select a question, and give Tim the option he picked on that question (which is 'filled out' from his switch-point). <br>
    Let's suppose I randomly selected question 1001 (which corresponds to $10.00), and Tim said his switch-point was $3.00. <br>
    Then, I would give Tim the money, as his switch-point indicates that he would prefer the $10.00 to the pencil.
<p>
<p>
    To make things more concrete, let's look at an example.
</p>
<h5> Example 1a</h5>
<p>
    Suppose Tim's true switch point is $9.50 (which is question number 1001).
    If I offered Tim less than $9.50, he would prefer to receive the pencil.
    Likewise, if I offered Tim more than $9.50, he would prefer to receive the money.
</p>

<p>
    Now, let's suppose Tim lies and tells me that his switch point is $8.50.
    Let's suppose that question 901 (which corresponds to $9) was randomly selected.
    Since Tim has said his switch-point is $8, I would give him the money instead of the pencil.
    However, Tim would prefer the pencil to $9.
    So, if Tim lies about his switch-point he may end up receive an outcome he prefers less!
</p>

<h3> The lottery switch-point procedure</h3>

<p>
    I can also apply the switch-point procedure to determine how much you value an item in terms of a lottery.
    Let's suppose I want to determine how much Luke values a pencil in terms of a lottery with two outcomes:
<p>
    <ul>
    <li> Outcome 1: Luke gets to leave the experiment right now (and gets full payment). </li>
    <li> Outcome 2: Luke has to read some boring information, (correctly) answer some questions on this information, then continue with the experiment.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    The steps I would take are as follows:
</p>

<h5>Step 1: Give Luke a list of questions</h5>
<p>
    The first thing I'd do is give a Luke a list of questions like the ones in the table below. <br>
    This a <b>different</b> table to the one above!<br>
</p>
    {{ include 'BDM/SPB.html'}}
<br>
<h5>Step 2: Tell Luke there is a 1% chance a question will be randomly selected</h5>
<p>
    Unlike the monetary switch-point procedure, there is now only a 1% chance that a question will be randomly selected.
    All questions are still equally likely to be selected (but there is a 99% chance that no question will be selected).
</p>
<h5>Step 3: Ask Luke for his switch-point </h5>
<p>
    In this case, Luke's <b>switch-point</b> is the percentage chance of leaving at which Luke would switch from option A to option B. <br>
    Once Luke has told me his switch-point, I can ‘fill out’ Luke's answers to all 101 questions based on his switch point (choosing Option A for all questions before his switch point, and Option B for all questions at or after his switch point). <br>
    Luke still has no reason to lie about his switch-point, as lying might lead to an option that he prefers less.
</p>
<h5>Step 4: (Potentially) pick a question </h5>
<p>
    Once Luke has told me his switch-point, I will use a random-number-generator to randomly determine several things. <br>
    First, I will use the random-number-generator to determine whether a question is picked (which occurs with 1% probability). <br>
    If a question needs to be picked, then I will randomly select a question, and give Luke the option he selected on that question (which is 'filled out' from his switch-point).
    If Luke chose the pencil on the question I picked, he would get the pencil for sure. <br>
    If Luke chose the lottery on the question I picked, I would run the lottery in that question. <br>
    Luke would get to leave the experiment (and receive the full monetary compensation) if that was the outcome from the lottery, or have to read the boring information and answer questions otherwise.
</p>
<h5> Example 2a</h5>
<p>
    Suppose Luke's true switch point is 33.5%. <br>
    If I offered Luke a lottery with a less than 33.5% chance of leaving immediately, Luke would prefer the pencil. <br>
    Likewise, if I offered Luke a lottery with a greater than 33.5%chance of leaving immediately, he would prefer to take the lottery. <br>
</p>
<p>
    Now, let's suppose Luke lies and tells me that his switch point is 50%.
    Let's suppose that question 41 (which corresponds to 40%) was randomly selected.
    Since Luke has said his switch-point is 50%, I would give him the pencil instead of the lottery.
    However, Luke would prefer the lottery to the pencil.
    So, if Luke lies about his switch-point he may end up receive an outcome he prefers less!
</p>

<h2> Summary</h2>
<p>
    The switch-point procedure is a way that I can determine your valuation for a task or an item. <br>
    Your switch point is the monetary value (or percentage chance of leaving) that causes you to switch from option A to option B <br>
    You have no reason to lie about your switch-point, because lying might leave you with an outcome that you prefer less. <br>
