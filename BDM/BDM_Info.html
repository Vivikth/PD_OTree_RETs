<p>In this experiment, I want to determine how much you value objects or tasks.
    I will use the switch-point procedure for this purpose.
    I'll explain the procedure using 2 examples. </p>
<br>

<h2> Example One</h2>
<p>
    Let's suppose that I want to determine how much you value a pencil, in terms of money.
    I would ask you the following questions:
</p>

    {{ include 'BDM/SPA.html'}}

<br>

<p>
    In each question, you pick either option A (the pencil) or option B (the money).
    After you answer all 2001 questions, I will randomly pick one question, and give you the option you chose on that question.
    Each question is equally likely to be chosen for payment.
    Obviously you have no incentive to lie on any question, because if that question gets chosen for payment then you’d end up with the option you like less.
</p>
<p>
    I assume you’re going to choose the Option A in at least the first few questions, but at some point switch to choosing Option B.
    So, to save time, just tell me at which dollar value you’d switch.  I can then ‘fill out’ your answers to all 2001 questions based on your switch point (choosing Option A for all questions before your switch point, and Option B for all questions at or after your switch point).
</p>
<p>
    I’ll still draw one question randomly for payment.
    Again, if you lie about your true switch point you might end up getting an option that you like less.
</p>

<h2> Example Two</h2>
<p>
    I can also apply the switch-point procedure to determine how much you value an item in terms of a lottery.
    Let's suppose I want to determine how much you value a pencil in terms of the probability of leaving the experiment right now (and getting full payment), or watching a boring video and answering some questions before continuing with the rest of the experiment.
    In this case, I would ask you the following questions:
</p>

    {{ include 'BDM/SPB.html'}}
<br>

<p>
    Like the monetary example above, in each question, you pick either option A (the pencil) or option B (the lottery). <br>
    However in this case, there will be a 5% chance that I randomly pick a question, and give you the option you chose on that question. <br>
    You still have no incentive to lie on any question, because if that question gets chosen for payment then you’d end up with the option you like less. <br>
</p>
<p>
    If you chose the pencil on the question I picked, you would get the pencil for sure. <br>
    If you chose the lottery on the question I picked, I would run the lottery with the probabilities specified in the question I picked. <br>
    You’ll get to leave the experiment (and receive the full monetary compensation) if that is the outcome from the lottery, or have to watch the boring video and answer questions otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    I assume you’re going to choose the Option A in at least the first few questions, but at some point will switch to choosing Option B. <br>
    So, to save time, just tell me at which probability you’d switch. <br>
    I can then ‘fill out’ your answers to all 99 questions based on your switch point (choosing Option A for all questions before your switch point, and Option B for all questions at or after your switch point). <br>
    I’ll still draw one question randomly. <br>
    Again, if you lie about your true switch point you might end up getting an option that you like less.
