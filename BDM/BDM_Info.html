<p>In this experiment, I want to determine how much you value completing a task or how much you value items. <br>
    I will use the switch-point procedure for this purpose. <br>
    The switch-point procedure is where I provide you with two options, and ask when you'd switch from choosing one option to the next. <br>
    The procedure is explained below.
    <br>

<h3>The monetary switch-point procedure</h3>
<p>
    Let's suppose that I want to determine how much Tim values a pencil. <br>
    Here are the steps I'd take. <br>
</p>

<h5>Step 1: Give Tim a list of questions</h5>
<p>
    The first thing I'd do is give a Tim a list of questions like the ones in the table below. <br>
    Each row in the table (apart from the header row) shows a question that I'd ask Tim. <br>
    In each question, Tim picks either option A (the pencil) or option B (the money). <br>
</p>
    {{ include 'BDM/SPA.html'}}
<br>
<h5>Step 2: Tell Tim there is a 1% chance that a question will be randomly selected</h5>
<p>
    All questions are equally likely to be selected, but there is only a 1% chance that a question will be selected. <br>
    If Tim lies about which option he prefers on a question, and that question gets chosen for payment then Tim would end up with the option he likes less. <br>
    So, Tim has no reason to lie!
</p>
<h5>Step 3: Ask Tim for his switch-point </h5>
<p>
    A reasonable assumption is that Tim prefers option A for the first few questions, but at some point will switch to choosing option B. <br>
    So, to save time, I'll just ask Tim for his <b>switch-point</b>: the monetary value at which he'd switch from choosing option A to option B. <br>
    Once Tim has told me his switch-point, I can ‘fill out’ Tim's answers to all 2001 questions based on his switch point (choosing Option A for all questions before his switch point, and Option B for all questions at or after his switch point). <br>
</p>
<h5>Step 4: (Potentially) pick a question at random </h5>
<p>
    If I randomly select a question, I will give Tim the option he picked on that question. <br>
    For instance, if I randomly selected question 1001 (which corresponds to $10.00), and Tim said he preferred the pencil on that question, I would give Tim the pencil.
</p>
That's all there is to the monetary switch-point procedure!
<h3> The lottery switch-point procedure </h3>
<p>
    I can also apply the switch-point procedure to determine how much you value an item in terms of a lottery.
    Let's suppose I want to determine how much Luke values a pencil in terms of a lottery with two outcomes:
</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Outcome 1: Luke gets to leave the experiment right now (and gets full payment). </li>
    <li> Outcome 2: Luke has to complete a reading activity, which involves reading some text and then correctly answering questions on this text. Luke gets to leave the experiment (and receive full payment) after completing this activity.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
In this case, I would give Luke a list of questions like in the table below:
</p>
    {{ include 'BDM/SPB.html'}}
<br>
<p>
    I would then ask Luke for his <b>switch-point</b>: the percentage chance of leaving at which Luke would switch from option A to option B.<br>
    Then, if I randomly select a question, I will give Luke the option he chose on that question. <br>
        If Luke chose the pencil on the question I picked, he would get the pencil for sure. <br>
    If Luke chose the lottery on the question I picked, I would run the lottery in that question. <br>
    Luke would get to leave the experiment (and receive the full monetary compensation) if that was the outcome from the lottery, or have to complete the reading activity otherwise.
</p>


<h5> An Example</h5>
<p>
    Suppose Luke's true switch point is 33.5%. <br>
    If I offered Luke a lottery with a less than 33.5% chance of leaving immediately, Luke would prefer the pencil. <br>
    Likewise, if I offered Luke a lottery with a greater than 33.5%chance of leaving immediately, he would prefer to take the lottery. <br>
</p>
<p>
    Now, let's suppose Luke lies and tells me that his switch point is 50%.
    Let's suppose that question 41 (which corresponds to 40%) was randomly selected.
    Since Luke has said his switch-point is 50%, I would give him the pencil instead of the lottery.
    However, Luke would prefer the lottery to the pencil.
    So, if Luke lies about his switch-point he may end up receive an outcome he prefers less!
</p>

<h2> Summary</h2>
<p>
    The switch-point procedure is a way that I can determine your valuation for a task or an item. <br>
    Your switch point is the monetary value (or percentage chance of leaving) that causes you to switch from option A to option B. <br>
    You have no reason to lie about your switch-point, because lying might leave you with an outcome that you prefer less. <br>
