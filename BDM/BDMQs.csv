"I used the monetary switch-point procedure to determine how much Evan values a cheeseburger. Evan said that his switch point for a single cheeseburger was $10. Evan also stated (truthfully) that he prefers more cheeseburgers to less. Which of the following is true?","Evan’s switch-point for 2 cheeseburgers would be higher than $10","Evan’s switch-point for 2 cheeseburgers would be lower than $10","Evan’s switch-point for 2 cheeseburgers would be equal to $10","There is not enough information to pick one of the above","A"
"I used the pseudo switch-point procedure to determine how much Sally values a chocolate bar. Which of the following is a potential negative outcome for Sally if she lies on one of the questions?","There are no negative consequences associated with lying for Sally","Sally’s lie will affect the experimental results","Sally won’t get her preferred outcome if the question she lied on is randomly selected","Sally will spend more time in the experiment","C"
"I used the lottery switch-point procedure to determine how much Sally values a chocolate bar. Which of the following is a potential negative outcome for Sally if she lies about her switch-point?","Sally’s lie will affect the experimental results","Sally may not always get her preferred outcome","There are no negative consequences associated with lying for Sally","Sally will spend more time in the experiment","B"
"I used the lottery switch-point procedure to determine how much Simon values an ice-cream). Simon (truthfully) stated that his switch-point is 60%. From this, we can infer:","Simon prefers an ice-cream to leaving the experiment right now","Simon prefers leaving the experiment right now to an ice-cream","Simon is indifferent between leaving the experiment right now and an ice-cream","There is not enough information to pick one of the above","D"
"I used the lottery switch-point procedure to determine how much Kriti values a mug. Suppose Kriti states that her switch-point for 1 mug is 100%,and her switch point for 2 mugs is also 100%. Kriti also (truthfully) states that she prefers 2 mugs to 1 mug. What can we infer?","Kriti prefers 1 mug to 2 mugs","Kriti prefers 2 mugs to leaving the experiment right now","Kriti prefers leaving the experiment right now to 1 mug","There is not enough information to pick one of the above","B"
"Mishika must pick between a toy and some money. She would prefer the toy to $3, and prefer $5 to the toy. Suppose Mishika is given $4. Which of the following can we conclude?","She would be happier if she received the toy, as her monetary switch point is $5","She would be less happy if she received the toy, as her monetary switch point is $3","She would be exactly as happy if she received the toy, as her monetary switch point is $4","We cannot determine whether the toy would make Mishika less or more happy as we do not know her monetary switch point","D"
"I used the monetary switch-point procedure to determine how much Christian values a muesli bar. Christian is allergic to nuts, and so prefers any amount of money to a muesli bar. What can we infer about Christian’s switch-point?","Christian’s switch-point is less than $2","Christian’s switch-point is more than $2","Christian’s switch-point is equal to $2","The question provides insufficient information to pick one of the above","A"
"I used the monetary switch-point procedure to determine how much Sabi values a soft drink. Sabi's true switch-point is $4, but he lied and told me his switch-point is $6. What happens if I randomly select question 5001 (with corresponds to $5)?","Sabi receives $5, which he prefers to the soft drink","Sabi receives the soft-drink, which he prefers to 5$","Sabi receives the soft drink, but would prefer $5","Sabi receives $5, but he would prefer the soft drink","C"
"I used the lottery switch-point procedure to determine how much Borys values a pizza. His true switch-point is 70%, but he lied and told me his switch-point is 50%. What happens if I randomly select question 81 (which corresponds to 80%)?","Borys receives the 80% lottery, which he prefers to the pizza","Borys receives the 80% lottery, but would prefer the pizza","Borys receives the pizza, which he prefers to the 80% lottery","Borys receives the pizza, but would prefer the 80% lottery","A"
"I used the lottery switch-point procedure to determine Jack's switch-points for a spoon and a fork. Jack told me (truthfully) that his switch-point  for a spoon is 40%, and his switch-point for a fork is 70%.  Which of the following is correct?","If Jack prefers leaving the experiment immediately to reading the boring information and continuing with the experiment, then Jack prefers the spoon to the fork","If Jack prefers leaving the experiment immediately to reading the boring information and continuing with the experiment, then Jack prefers the fork to the spoon","If Jack does not prefer leaving the experiment immediately to reading the boring information and continuing with the experiment, then Jack prefers the spoon to the fork","If Jack does not prefer leaving the experiment immediately to reading the boring information and continuing with the experiment, then Jack prefers the fork to the spoon","B"
