<h3>Text Instructions</h3>

<p>
    You are about to participate in an experiment in the economics of decision-making. <br>
    If you <b>complete</b> this experiment, you will earn <b>${{ Constants.payment_amount }}</b>, which will be paid to you via PayPal at the end of the experiment. <br>
    On average, I expect that the experiment will take approximately 45 minutes. <br>
</p>
<br>
<h3> The Basic Idea </h3>
<p>
    In this experiment, you will have to complete several <b>computerized tasks</b> using your computer. <br>
    There will be 5 categories of computerized tasks in this experiment. <br>
    Each category contains <b>4</b> different levels of tasks, with level 1 being the easiest, and level 4 being the hardest. <br>
    All task categories are designed to be equally difficult, but you may be able to complete tasks from one category quicker than others due to your own aptitudes and abilities.
</p>
<p>
    You will be able to choose which tasks you want to complete - so choosing appropriately will allow you to complete the experiment quicker. <br>
    However, you will <b>not</b> know what a task entails before you make your choice. <br>
    Instead, you will be given a <b>vague description</b> of each task, and have to make your choice based on these vague descriptions. <br>
    You can click the text below to see the vague descriptions of each task category.
</p>
<br>

<details>
    <summary> Click this text to show / hide the vague descriptions of the tasks</summary>
    {{ include 'RET_Choice/Task_Descriptions.html'}}

</details>

<br>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>
    This experiment has 4 stages. <br>
    First, I will ask you some questions about how much you value completing an unknown task.
    There is a small chance that you will be able to immediately complete the experiment after this stage.     <br>
    Afterwards, you will choose the tasks you want to complete from a specified list. <br>
    Next, I will randomly pick some of your choices, and you will complete the tasks that were randomly picked. <br>
    Finally, you will answer a simple demographic survey at the end of the experiment. <br>
    Please note that you will only be paid if you <b>complete</b> the demographic survey.
</p>


<h3>Quick Questions</h3>
<p>
    Before moving on, please answer the following questions.
</p>

    <label>   How much will you be paid if you <b>complete</b> the experiment?</label>
<div>
    <label>$</label>
    <input name="payment_question">
</div>
{{ formfield_errors 'payment_question' }}

<br>
{{ formfield 'visual_abilities' label="Which task requires the use of visual abilities to interpret signs?" }}

{{ formfield 'num_levels' label="How many levels are in each task category?" }}

{{ formfield 'num_categories' label="How many task categories are there?" }}



<h4>The next stage</h4>
<p> As part of this experiment, I want to determine how much you value completing an unknown task. <br>
    I will use a procedure called the switch-point procedure for this purpose. <br>
    Click the next button to learn about the switch-point procedure.

<h2 id="NextHead">Next Button will appear once video has been watched </h2>

<div id="div1" style="visibility: hidden;">
        {% next_button %}
</div>
