<p>
    Thanks for providing your valuations for those tasks! <br>
    We won't be using the switch-point procedure anymore, so you can relax and forget about it! <br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
    We will now be running the lottery that we specified. <br>
    There is a 4% chance that one of your switch-points will be selected. <br>
</p>
<br>

<details>

    <summary>    Click here to see whether we used one of your switch points.</summary>
    {{ if player.Rand_Outcome == "C" }}
<p>
    None of your switch-point questions were selected. <br>
    Click the next button to proceed with the rest of the experiment.
</p>
    {{ endif }}

    {{ if player.Rand_Outcome == "BW" }}
<p>
    One of your switch points was selected. <br>
    We selected {{player.Rand_T}} as the task. <br>
    We selected question number {{player.BDM_Num}} as the question. <br>
    Your switch-point for this task was {{ switch_point }}. <br>
</p>
<br>
        {{if switch_point > player.BDM_Num}}
    <p>
        Your switch-point was higher than the selected question. <br>
        This means you said that you prefer the task {{player.Rand_T}} to the lottery in that question <br>
        Click the next button to complete the task. <br>
    </p>
        {{endif}}

        {{if player.BDM_Num >= switch_point }}
    <p>
        Your switch-point was lower than the selected question. <br>
        This means you said that you prefer the lottery to completing the task {{player.Rand_T}}. <br>
    </p>

            <details>
                <summary>Click here to see the outcome of the lottery.</summary>

                {{if player.lot_outcome < player.BDM_Num}}
            <p>
                The outcome of the lottery was the best task! <br>
                This means you get to leave the experiment without completing any tasks. <br>
                Press the next button to finish the experiment.
            </p>
            {{endif}}

            {{if player.lot_outcome >= player.BDM_Num}}
            <p>
                The outcome of the lottery was the worst task. <br>
                This means that you have to read some boring information and answer some questions before continuing. <br>
                Press the next button to read the boring information. <br>
            </p>
