<!--Need task description, etc. -->
<p>
    In this stage of the experiment, I want to determine how much you value an unknown task. <br>
    I'll give you a vague description of a task, and use the switch-point procedure to determine how much you value that task. <br>
    I've put information about the switch-point procedure at the bottom of the page if you'd like to refer to it. <br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
   This task is called <strong>Tabulation</strong> .<br>
   The task description is: <strong> Subjects must use their mathematical abilities to tabulate quantities </strong>.  <br>
    To determine your valuation for this task, I will ask you the following questions.
</p>
<br>
{{ include Constants.BDMQs_Table }}
<br>
<p>
    To save time, I'll ask you just for your switch point. <br>
    Please enter your answer as a percentage (i.e a number between 0 and 100), which is the chance you assign to leaving. <br>
    Feel free to enter a decimal (e.g 32.3) if you think that it is a more accurate representation of your switch point. <br>
    Note: There is a 5% chance that one of these questions will be selected, and your chosen option (calculated from your switch point) for that question will be enacted.
