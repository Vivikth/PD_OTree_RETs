"I used the BDM procedure to determine how much Evan values a cheeseburger, in terms of money. Evan said that his switch point for a single cheeseburger was $10. Evan also stated (truthfully) that he prefers more cheeseburgers to less. Which of the following is true?","Evan’s switch-point for 2 cheeseburgers would be higher than $10","Evan’s switch-point for 2 cheeseburgers would be lower than $10","Evan’s switch-point for 2 cheeseburgers would be equal to $10","There is not enough information to pick one of the above","A"
"I used the BDM procedure to determine how much Sally values a chocolate bar. Which of the following is a potential negative outcome for Sally if she lies on one of the questions?","There are no negative consequences associated with lying for Sally","Sally’s lie will affect the experimental results","Sally won’t get her preferred outcome if the question she lied on is randomly selected","Sally will spend more time in the experiment","C"
"I used the BDM procedure to determine how much Sally values a chocolate bar. Which of the following is a potential negative outcome for Sally if she lies about her switch-point?","Sally’s lie will affect the experimental results","Sally may not always get her preferred outcome","There are no negative consequences associated with lying for Sally","Sally will spend more time in the experiment","B"
"I used the BDM procedure to determine how much Simon values an ice-cream in terms of the probability of leaving the experiment right now. Simon stated that his switch-point is 60%. From this, we can infer:","Simon prefers an ice-cream to leaving the experiment right now","Simon prefers leaving the experiment right now to an ice-cream","Simon is indifference between leaving the experiment right now and an ice-cream","There is not enough information to pick one of the above","D"
"I used the BDM procedure to determine how much Kriti values a mug in terms of the probability of leaving the experiment right now. Suppose Kriti states that her switch-point for 1 mug is 100%,and her switch point for 2 mugs is also 100%. Kriti also (truthfully) states that she prefers 2 mugs to 1 mug. What can we infer?","Kriti prefers 1 mug to 2 mugs","Kriti prefers 2 mugs to leaving the experiment right now","Kriti prefers leaving the experiment right now to 1 mug","There is not enough information to pick one of the above","B"
"Mishika must pick between a toy and some money. She would prefer the toy to $3, and prefer $5 to the toy. Suppose Mishika is given $4. Which of the following can we conclude?","She would be happier if she received the toy, as her switch point is $5","She would be less happy if she received the toy, as her switch point is $3","She would be exactly as happy if she received the toy, as her switch point is $4","We cannot determine whether the toy would make Mishika less or more happy as we do not know her switch point","D"
"I used the BDM procedure to determine how much Christian values a muesli bar in terms of money. Christian is allergic to nuts, and so prefers any amount of money to a muesli bar. What can we infer about Christian’s switch-point?","Christian’s switch-point is less than $2","Christian’s switch-point is more than $2","Christian’s switch-point is equal to $2","The question provides insufficient information to pick one of the above","A"
"I used the BDM procedure to determine how much Borys and Sabi value a coffee in terms of the probability of leaving the experiment right now. Borys stated his switch-point was 25%, while Sabi stated his switch point was 50%. Both Borys and Sabi prefer leaving the experiment right now to not leaving the experiment right now. What can we infer?","Borys values coffee more than Sabi","Borys and Sabi both value coffee the same","Sabi values coffee more than Borys","The question provides insufficient information to pick one of the above","D"
