<p>
    In this stage of the experiment, I want to determine how much you value completing a task from each category. <br>
    I'll give you a vague description of each task, and then use the switch-point procedure to determine how much you value that task. <br>
    I've put information about the switch-point procedure at the bottom of the page if you'd like to refer back to it. <br>
    Press the next button to continue to the next page.
