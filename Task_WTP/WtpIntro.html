<p>
    In this stage of the experiment, I want to determine how much you value completing a task from each category. <br>
    I'll use the switch-point procedure to determine how much you value each task based on its vague description. <br>
    There is a <b>5%</b> chance that one of the switch-point procedure questions in this stage will be selected. <br>
    I've put information about the switch-point procedure at the bottom of the page if you'd like to refer back to it. <br>
    Press the next button to continue.
