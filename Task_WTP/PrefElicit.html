    In this stage of the experiment, I want to determine how much you value a task from each category. <br>
    I'll give you a vague description of each task, and then use the switch-point procedure to determine how much you value that task. <br>
    I've put information about the switch-point procedure at the bottom of the page if you'd like to refer back to it. <br>
</p>
<br>

<h4> How much do you value completing the <b>{{Task_name}} (level 1)</b> task?</h4>
<p>
    This task is called <strong>{{Task_name}} (level 1)</strong>.<br>
    The task description is: <strong> {{Task_description}}</strong>.  <br>
    You need to pick between completing this task (and leaving the experiment after completing it), or a lottery.
    I will ask you the following questions.
</p>
<br>
{{ include 'Task_WTP/Task_BDMQs.html' }}
<br>
<p>
    To save time, I'll just ask you for your switch point (in terms of the percentage chance you will be able to leave the experiment). <br>
    Please enter your answer as a percentage (i.e a number between 0 and 100). <br>
<!--    Feel free to enter a decimal (e.g 32.3) if you think that it is a more accurate representation of your switch point. <br>-->
    Note: There is a 1% chance that one of these questions will be selected, and your chosen option (calculated from your switch point) for that question will be implemented.
