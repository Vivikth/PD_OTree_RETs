    In this stage of the experiment, I want to determine how much you value a task from each category. <br>
    I'll use the switch-point procedure to determine how much you value each task based on its vague description. <br>
    I've put information about the switch-point procedure at the bottom of the page if you'd like to refer back to it. <br>
</p>
<br>

<h4> How much do you value completing the <b>{{Task_name}} (level 1)</b> task?</h4>
<p>
    This task is called <strong>{{Task_name}} (level 1)</strong>.<br>
    The task description is: <strong> {{Task_description}}</strong>.  <br>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Option A</b> means you complete this task, and then  get to leave the experiment (receiving full payment). <br>
    <b>Option B</b> means you get a lottery with the following outcomes:
</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Outcome 1: You get to leave the experiment right now (receiving full payment). </li>
    <li> Outcome 2: You have to complete a reading activity, which involves reading some text and then correctly answering questions on this text. You then get to leave the experiment (and receive full payment) after completing this activity.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    I will ask you the following questions.
</p>
<br>
{{ include 'Task_WTP/Task_BDMQs.html' }}
<br>
<p>
    To save time, I'll just ask you for your <b>switch-point</b>: the percentage chance of leaving at which you would switch from option A to option B. <br>
    Please enter your answer as a percentage (i.e a number between 0 and 100). <br>
    Note: There is a 1% chance that one of these questions will be selected, and your chosen option (calculated from your switch point) for that question will be implemented.
