<h3>Researcher:</h3>
    <p>My name is Dr. Evan Calford, and I am a John Mitchell Fellow in the Research School of Economics at the Australian National University.</p>

    <h3>Project Title:</h3>
    <p>Experiments on the economics of decision making</p>

    <h3>General Outline of the Project:</h3>

        <p>
            <b>Description and Methodology:</b> For this experiment, you will participate in a series of decision making rounds. In each round you will be placed in a group with other participants and you will enter your decision via a browser on your computer. The outcome in each round will depend on both your decision and the decisions of other participants in the group.
    </p>

<p> <b>Participants:</b>  Each session of this experiment will contain approximately 20 participants, and I will run multiple sessions. You will only be able to participate in at most one session of the experiment. Participants will be recruited from the Research School of Economics Experimental Participant Sign-up System.
</p>

        <p> <b>Use of Data and Feedback:</b>  The data will be used to produce peer-reviewed published articles and conference presentations. The research results will be made available, once the research is completed, on my research homepage: https://sites.google.com/site/evancalford/
        </p>


    <h3>Participant Involvement:</h3>

    <p> <b>Voluntary Participation & Withdrawal:</b> Your participation in this research is voluntary, and you may decline to take part or withdraw from the research without providing an explanation at any time until the completion of the experiment (at which time data is stored in the database without any way to identify and remove your data). Within the research you may decline to answer any question about yourself. If you withdraw, the individual data you have provided prior to withdrawal will be destroyed and not used where feasible. In some cases, because data is recorded in groups, it may not be possible to remove your data.
    </p>

<p><b>What does participation in the research entail?</b>  Your participation will begin with the instructions for the research being read aloud via a Zoom call. The zoom call will not be recorded or used for research purposes in any way; it is merely a way to disseminate information to you. You will proceed to a website link that we will provide, and you will complete the experiment at that website. We will record the decisions that you enter on the website, and you will enter your decisions using your mouse and/or keyboard. At the end of the experiment you will complete a brief demographic survey.
</p>

    <p><b>Location and Duration:</b> The experiment will take place online, via our website. The experiment is expected to last, in total, approximately 60 to 90 minutes.
    </p>

    <p><b>Remuneration:</b> You will be paid for your participation in this experiment. Your payment will depend on your decisions made during the experiment, and on the decisions of other participants in your group. You will receive $5 for completing the experiment, plus any additional money you earn during the course of the experiment. Your total payment for the experiment is expected to be in the range of $15 to $35.

    <p><b>Risks:</b> This research does not involve any risk beyond that associated with everyday use of the internet to interact with other people. We will turn off all microphones during the Zoom call at the start of the experiment, disable the chat function, and we will assign each of you a random ID during the call.</p>

    <p><b>Benefits:</b> It is unlikely that you will personally benefit from participation in this research. However, the work will improve our understanding of the ways in which humans make decisions in economic environments.
    </p>

    <h3>Confidentiality:</h3>

    <p><b>Confidentiality:</b>  We will keep your identity confidential as far as allowed by law. Once your data is recorded into our database it will not be possible to identify your data. Record of your participation in the experiment will be kept separately from the experimental data.
 </p>
