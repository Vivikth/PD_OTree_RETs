<!--<h3>Researcher:</h3>-->
<!--    <p>-->
<!--        My name is Vivikth Narayanan, and I am an economics honours student at the Australian National University.-->
<!--    </p>-->

<!--    <h3>Project Title:</h3>-->
<!--    <p>Effect of Information on Experimentation Behaviour</p>-->

<!--    <h3>General Outline of the Project:</h3>-->

<!--        <p>-->
<!--            <b>Description and Methodology:</b>-->
<!--For this experiment, you will participate in a series of decision-making stages. In the first stage, you will answer questions about your willingness to complete unknown tasks. You will be given a vague description of each task you might have to complete.  In the second stage, you will choose tasks to complete from a given list. In the third and final stage, you will complete the tasks you have chosen.-->
<!--    </p>-->

<!--<p> <b>Participants:</b>-->
<!--You will not interact with any other participants over the course of this experiment. You will only be able to participate in this experiment one time. Participants will be recruited from the Research School of Economics Experimental Participant Sign-up System. A maximum of 50 participants will be able to complete the experiment in a single day.-->
<!--</p>-->

<!--        <p> <b>Use of Data and Feedback:</b>-->
<!--            The data collected from this experiment will be used to produce my thesis. The research results will be made available, once the research is complete at the following link: shorturl.at/nprFK-->
<!--        </p>-->


<!--    <h3>Participant Involvement:</h3>-->

<!--    <p> <b>Voluntary Participation & Withdrawal:</b>-->
<!--Your participation in this research is voluntary, and you may-->
<!--decline to take part or withdraw from the research without providing an explanation at any time until the-->
<!--completion of the experiment (at which time data is stored in the database without any way to identify-->
<!--and remove your data). Within the research you may decline to answer any question about yourself. If-->
<!--you withdraw, the individual data you have provided prior to withdrawal will be destroyed and not used-->
<!--where feasible.-->
<!--    </p>-->

<!--<p><b>What does participation in the research entail?</b>-->
<!--    Your participation will begin with the instructions for the-->
<!--research being read aloud via a Zoom call. The zoom call will not be recorded or used for research purposes in any way; it is merely a way to disseminate information to you. You will proceed to a website link that we will provide, and you will complete the experiment at that website. We will record the decisions that you enter on the website, and you will enter your decisions using your mouse and/or keyboard. The experiment will consist of several different activities, all of which will be completed on your computer. At the end of the experiment, you will complete a brief demographic survey.-->

<!--</p>-->

<!--    <p><b>Location and Duration:</b>-->
<!--The experiment will take place online, via our website. The experiment is expected to last (in total) approximately 30 to 60 minutes.-->
<!--    </p>-->

<!--    <p><b>Remuneration:</b>-->
<!--You will be paid for your participation in this experiment. You will receive a fixed fee of $20 if you complete the experiment and will not receive any money if you do not complete the experiment. The decisions you make during the experiment will not affect your payment. However, the decisions you make will affect the time it takes for you to complete the experiment.-->
<!--    </p>-->
<!--<p><b>Risks:</b>-->
<!--This research does not involve any risks beyond that associated with everyday use of the internet. The tasks you will have to complete will not place you in any physical or psychological harm.    </p>-->

<!--    <p><b>Benefits:</b>-->
<!--It is unlikely that you will personally benefit from participation in this research. However, the work will improve our understanding of how information affects the decisions humans make in economic environments.    </p>-->

<!--    <h3>Confidentiality:</h3>-->

<!--    <p><b>Confidentiality:</b>  We will keep your identity confidential as far as allowed by law. Once your data is recorded into our database it will not be possible to identify your data. Record of your participation in the experiment will be kept separately from the experimental data.-->
<!-- </p>-->
